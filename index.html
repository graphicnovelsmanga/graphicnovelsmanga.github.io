Naruto is an amazing story about ninjas and is one of the best books i have ever read.
It is written by an amazing author called Masashi Kishimoto and it has a excellent plot and it is a great anime as well.
All the characters are really well developed and i could never stop reading it.There are 72 volumes so it took quite a long time to read 
but it was definitely worth the read.It was a big craze between me and my friends at school when someone brought in the first 20 volumes 
and then we took it in turns buying the next books.The ending is great and very satisfying so if you have the chance i sincerely 
recommend it.

<h2>Watchmen</h2>

Watchmen is different to Naruto because Nartuo is a manga but Watchmen is a Graphic novel and is probably more wordy, and adult but there 
is no doubt that Alan Moore -the writer- is one of the best Graphic novel authors out there and Watchmen is his best piece of work.But what
can i say because i've only ever read like two graphic novels and unfortunately Watchmen is also the only thing i've read by Alan Moore.
However i hope you can trust my opinion and have a go at reading Watchmen in your spare time if you haven't allready.
